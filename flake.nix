  # A LEAF by design. This repo emits the Qt plugin around a view's .rep and
  # *Backend, and builds the replica factory for the same .rep — neither of
  # which needs to read a LIDL contract, so nothing here depends on a generator
  # frontend, an SDK, or the protocol. Keeping it that way is what lets it be
  # re-pinned independently of the SDK stack.
